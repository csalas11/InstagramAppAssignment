# README

This project was for my CS121: Software Development course at Harvey Mudd. This was created using the tutorial from the following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE
We were asked to follow the tutorial and create a web application that allows for the uploading of images, while using a bootstrap bare style.

The following links were used while following the tutorial. Would like to thank all these open source projects and the tutorial for helping me to complete this
assignment. 

Devise GitHub link: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise
BootStrap GitHub link: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass 
Paperclip GitHub link: https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip  

It allows for the creation of a new user (registration), logging in, logging out, attaching files, and alerting the user when they have signed out as well as signed in. 
It shows all of the uploads that the user has created.
