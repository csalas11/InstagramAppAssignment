# README

This project was for my CS121: Software Development course at Harvey Mudd. This was created using the tutorial from the following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE
We were asked to follow the tutorial and create a web application that allows for the uploading of images, while using a bootstrap bare style. 

It allows for the creation of a new user (registration), logging in, logging out, attaching files, and alerting the user when they have signed out as well as signed in. 
It shows all of the uploads that the user has created.
